	abstract = {Purpose Automatic and accurate three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of liver with severe diseases from computed tomography ({CT}) images is a challenging task. Fully convolutional networks ({FCNs}) have emerged as powerful tools for automatic semantic segmentation, with multiple potential applications in medical imaging. However, the use of a large receptive field and multiple pooling layers in the network leads to poor localization around object boundaries. The network usually makes pixel-wise prediction independently, making it difficult to respect local label consistency and enforce the smoothness of the object boundary. Methods We have developed an automatic liver segmentation method based on a novel framework that integrates fully convolutional network predictions into active contour models ({ACM}). We use only a single network architecture to generate a pixel label map containing spatial regional information (foreground and background) as well as layered boundary information. We exploit the structured network outcome to define an external constraint force of active contour models. A unique property of the designed force is that both its strength and direction are adaptive to its position and relative distance to the object boundary. The resulting integrated active contour models have the advantages of incorporating both high-level and low-level image information simultaneously, while enforcing the smoothness of the contour. Because the external constraint force can push the evolving contour to the liver boundary and exists everywhere in the image domain, it allows us to place the initial contour far away from the liver boundary. It potentially allows us to control the evolution of the contour in order to preserve the topology of the liver. Results We have trained and evaluated our model on 73 liver {CT} scans from a clinic study. The integrated {ACM} model yields mean dice coefficients ({DICE}) 95.8 ± 1.4 (\%). Without further fine-tuning the network weights for two independent datasets, it yields mean {DICE} 96.2 ± 0.9 (\%) for the {SLIVER}07 training dataset, and mean {DICE} 94.3 ± 2.7 (\%) for the {LiTS} training dataset. In comparison with {FCN} alone model, the integrated {ACM} model yields improvements in terms of surface distance and {DICE} values for almost all the cases. Furthermore, the initialization of the active contour can be very far away from the liver boundary. Conclusions Experimental results for segmenting livers (with severe diseases on {CT} images resulting in shape and density abnormalities) have revealed that our proposed model improves segmentation results in comparison with {FCN} alone. Without further fine-tuning the network weights for two independent datasets, the model is capable of handling image variations from different datasets due to its inherent deformable nature. It is relatively easy to integrate more advanced (either existing or future) {FCN} architecture into our framework to further improve the segmentation performance.},

	abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks ({AlexNet}, the {VGG} net, and {GoogLeNet}) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of {PASCAL} {VOC} (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean {IU} on 2012), {NYUDv}2, and {SIFT} Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

	abstract = {A novel scheme for the detection of object boundaries is presented. The technique is based on active contours evolving in time according to intrinsic geometric measures of the image. The evolving contours naturally split and merge, allowing the simultaneous detection of several objects and both interior and exterior boundaries. The proposed approach is based on the relation between active contours and the computation of geodesics or minimal distance curves. The minimal distance curve lays in a Riemannian space whose metric is defined by the image content. This geodesic approach for object segmentation allows to connect classical “snakes” based on energy minimization and geometric active contours based on the theory of curve evolution. Previous models of geometric active contours are improved, allowing stable boundary detection when their gradients suffer from large variations, including gaps. Formal results concerning existence, uniqueness, stability, and correctness of the evolution are presented as well. The scheme was implemented using an efficient algorithm for curve evolution. Experimental results of applying the scheme to real images including objects with holes and medical data imagery demonstrate its power. The results may be extended to 3D object segmentation as well.},

Our model can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by the gradient. We minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation, the problem becomes a "mean-curvature flow"-like evolving the active contour, which will stop on the desired boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. We give a numerical algorithm using finite differences. Finally, we present various experimental results and in particular some examples for which the classical snakes methods based on the gradient are not applicable. Also, the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and interior contours are automatically detected.},

We consider local rather than global image statistics and evolve a contour based on local information. Localized contours are capable of segmenting objects with heterogeneous feature profiles that would be difficult to capture correctly using a standard global method. The presented technique is versatile enough to be used with any global region-based active contour energy and instill in it the benefits of localization. We describe this framework and demonstrate the localization of three well-known energies in order to illustrate how our framework can be applied to any energy. We then compare each localized energy to its global counterpart to show the improvements that can be achieved. Next, an in-depth study of the behaviors of these energies in response to the degree of localization is given. Finally, we show results on challenging images to illustrate the robust and accurate segmentations that are possible with this new class of active contour models.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method that uses the level sets of volumes to reconstruct the shapes of 3D objects from range data. The strategy is to formulate 3D reconstruction as a statistical problem: find that surface which is mostly likely, given the data and some prior knowledge about the application domain. The resulting optimization problem is solved by an incremental process of deformation. We represent a deformable surface as the level set of a discretely sampled scalar function of three dimensions, i.e., a volume. Such level-set models have been shown to mimic conventional deformable surface models by encoding surface movements as changes in the greyscale values of the volume. The result is a voxel-based modeling technology that offers several advantages over conventional parametric models, including flexible topology, no need for reparameterization, concise descriptions of differential structure, and a natural scale space for hierarchical representations. This paper builds on previous work in both 3D reconstruction and level-set modeling. It presents a fundamental result in surface estimation from range data: an analytical characterization of the surface that maximizes the posterior probability. It also presents a novel computational technique for level-set modeling, called the sparse-field algorithm, which combines the advantages of a level-set approach with the computational efficiency and accuracy of a parametric representation. The sparse-field algorithm is more efficient than other approaches, and because it assigns the level set to a specific set of grid points, it positions the level-set model more accurately than the grid itself. These properties, computational efficiency and subcell accuracy, are essential when trying to reconstruct the shapes of 3D objects. Results are shown for the reconstruction objects from sets of noisy and overlapping range maps.},
